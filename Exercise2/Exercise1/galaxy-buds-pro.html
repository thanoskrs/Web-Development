        <h2>Product Description</h2>
        <p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro offers very good audio output.
            There's a notable boost in bass range sound, and a spike in 
            the very high range, but otherwise everything should sound pretty 
            much like it's supposed to. </p>

              <h3>Best earbuds in the market period.</h3>
              <ph>Rating: 4.5/5</ph>
              <pr>I honestly had my doubts not gonna lie.They were expensive they were a lot of other options but 
                honest to god i love them. Working out haw never been easier, i catch myself taking to the phone 
                just for the fun of it. I cant stop listening to music... and they are so comfy i honestly 
                sleep with them. The only downside is that maybe with so much talikng time the bill may come
                a little be overpriced!

              <h3>BEST EARPHONES HANDS DOWN!</h3>
              <ph>Rating: 5/5</ph>
              <pr>
                After owning and still using the first generation galaxy buds I wanted to see what an upgrade would do. Decided
                to wait after the 2nd generation, I had purchased the "beans" when they had first came out and to my disappointment
                and my opinion did not live up to even the 1st generation buds because of the change of shape of the buds and did not
                even support ambient features like the previous 2 models before so after some exercises and 2 days later ended up returning
                them and continued to wait for the next gen buds. I had purchased these bad boys and to my surprise had everything I was 
                looking for and more and was happy that they went for a sleeker and same look as the buds before the beans. Another thing worth
                mentioning and what sold me is when I found out about what the buds do automatically as soon as someone outside talks to you or 
                even as soon as it hears your voice it pauses whatever you're listening to and goes into the ambient mode so you can hear the outside 
                world without having to touch anything or even take them out of your ears and then 10 seconds later when the buds don't hear any voices 
                anymore goes back to playing music and drowns everything out completely so it's perfect serenity with only you and whatever you're listening to.

              <h3>I love these buds.. just won't always stay in my</h3>
              <ph>Rating: 4/5</ph>
              <pr>
                I love these ear buds.... mostly.  I love the talk quality (my #1 priority). It's top notch, absolutely wonderful.
                Listening quality, absolutely wonderful. But the part that actually goes in your ear, trash, trash and really trash.
                Please improve this. You can make a foam to better and cheaper than anyone else. Make it fit most ears please. Other
                than that, 8.5 out of 10.

              <h3> Horrible call sound quality</h3>
              <ph>Rating: 2/5</ph>
              <pr>
                I like these earbuds but i hate the call sound quality cause my voice will be breaking down while im talking
                with my earbuds! It really is a shame to spend so much money and get nothing in return , i feel like they]
                just stole my money and had a good laugh at it !!

              <h3>Great headphones</h3>
              <ph>Rating: 4/5</ph>
              <pr>
                I love these headphones. I use headphones all the time when working out when doing yard work and when working. When i am  
                working out and doing yard work i sweat alot and i have burned through othe headphones like crazy. But these ones do really 
                good. Havnt had a problem with them yet. I alos really like that you can switch between ambient noise and then noise canceling.
                Makes it great for whatever and wherever i am at.
