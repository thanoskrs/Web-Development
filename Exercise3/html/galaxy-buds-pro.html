                <p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro offers very good audio output.
                    There's a notable boost in bass range sound, and a spike in 
                    the very high range, but otherwise everything should sound pretty 
                    much like it's supposed to.

                    <q>I honestly had my doubts not gonna lie.They were expensive they were a lot of other options but 
                        honest to god i love them. Working out haw never been easier, i catch myself taking to the phone 
                        just for the fun of it. I cant stop listening to music... and they are so comfy i honestly 
                        sleep with them. The only downside is that maybe with so much talikng time the bill may come
                        a little be overpriced!

                    <q>
                        After owning and still using the first generation galaxy buds I wanted to see what an upgrade would do. Decided
                        to wait after the 2nd generation, I had purchased the "beans" when they had first came out and to my disappointment
                        and my opinion did not live up to even the 1st generation buds because of the change of shape of the buds and did not
                        even support ambient features like the previous 2 models before so after some exercises and 2 days later ended up returning
                        them and continued to wait for the next gen buds. I had purchased these bad boys and to my surprise had everything I was 
                        looking for and more and was happy that they went for a sleeker and same look as the buds before the beans. Another thing worth
                        mentioning and what sold me is when I found out about what the buds do automatically as soon as someone outside talks to you or 
                        even as soon as it hears your voice it pauses whatever you're listening to and goes into the ambient mode so you can hear the outside 
                        world without having to touch anything or even take them out of your ears and then 10 seconds later when the buds don't hear any voices 
                        anymore goes back to playing music and drowns everything out completely so it's perfect serenity with only you and whatever you're listening to.

                        I love these ear buds.... mostly.  I love the talk quality (my #1 priority). It's top notch, absolutely wonderful.
                        Listening quality, absolutely wonderful. But the part that actually goes in your ear, trash, trash and really trash.
                        Please improve this. You can make a foam to better and cheaper than anyone else. Make it fit most ears please. Other
                        than that, 8.5 out of 10.
