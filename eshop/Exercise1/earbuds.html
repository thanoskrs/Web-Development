                <p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro offers very good audio output.
                   There's a notable boost in bass range sound, and a spike in 
                   the very high range, but otherwise everything should sound pretty 
                   much like it's supposed to. Mostly, a frequency response like this means 
                   music should sound great pretty much all the time.</p>

                <p>The second-generation AirPods Pro are Apple's best earbuds yet. 
                   They sound better, have more effective noise cancelling, last longer 
                   on a charge and keep what is good about their predecessors. The onboard 
                   volume control is very welcome, as is the adaptive transparency feature.</p>

                <p>The Redmi Buds 3 Pro get the basics right and then go further by offering 
                   wireless charging, ear-detection and fast charging. These earphones deliver 
                   high-quality audio with sound that's well represented on the entire frequency range, 
                   from low to mid and high frequencies.</p>
