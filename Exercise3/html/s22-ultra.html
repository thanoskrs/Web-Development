                        The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is <b>the headliner of the S22 series</b>. It's the first S series phone to include Samsung's S Pen. 
                        Specifications are top-notch including 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, 
                        5000mAh battery, up to 12gigs of RAM, and 1TB of storage.
                        One of the Galaxy S22 Ultra's most impressive features is its <b>telephoto lens, which offers 10x optical zoom</b>. We are not sure how 
                        Samsung managed to fit this lens in such a low profile, but it's there, and it's like a pair of binoculars.

                    <q>I know that it's a lot of money, but I don't upgrade every time a new phone comes out. 
                        I'm really sad that there is no slot for an SD card because I take thousands of photos. 
                        So far everything is going well. Ilike the pen, it's the first time I have had one on my phone. 
                        The camera is nice, it has some really great editing features like shadow and glare removal. 
                        You can even remove a person or thing in the photo if you want to! I recommend!

                        This phone is a powerhouse and stops at nothing. I'm a web developer and I need a snappy phone 
                        that runs the latest and greatest, as well as provides me with mobile internet access all the 
                        time, and this phone does not disappoint. The cameras are also amazing, even compared to my old s20 FE. 
                        A great addition that I didn't expect to be so handy is the S-pen. It's great for jotting down quick 
                        notes, doodling at random, editing screenshots, etc. It even has music controls so that you can take 
                        the pen and control your music if you are one to plug your phone into a hi-fi away from your desk and 
                        such. If that's not your thing, it's nice to have extra tools sometimes when you need them, even if you 
                        don't use them often. The screen is also stunning even in comparison to my S20 FE, much brighter, sharper, 
                        and overall very color-accurate. Battery life is also great, and if I needed to I feel like I could get 2
                        days of power out of the battery without needing to plug in again. Hats off Samsung! Good job on this one.

                        Bought the Galaxy S22 Ultra as I wanted a camera with longer optical zoom for gig photos. The camera takes 
                        crisp sharp photos, colours are vibrant, portrait background blur is almost there, with some anomalies but 
                        but usually hardly noticeable. I would like bulb mode or longer than 30s max time, ie 900s for ND filters, 
                        as you can get filter holders for this and a tripod clamp, this potentially could take great long exposure 
                        shots as a much lighter kit than a DSLR. Battery normally lasting about 5 days as I am not a prolific phone 
                        user. Very impressed so far.

                        I am an Android user from the beginning of Android phones. Everything is just a tick below perfection. To power 
                        it off you have to press 2 buttons and use 2 hands to do it. Liked my S9+ better but it lacked some neat features 
                        of this S22U. I have a S5 that I use strictly as a car phone that I still like but it just did not have enough memory. 
                        If it did I'd still be using it. Also, it seems heavy. Haven't weighed it yet But I will soon just for my own knowledge. 
                        A lot to learn about the S-pen. A lot!

                        No removable storage & no headphones insert. Just make sure you know this. I am not happy about it but I will switching 
                        this phone to another line that doesn't require much more storage and I never use headphones but for those who do. You need 
                        an adapter for the headset. I am going to look for the another phone that allows headphones and SD card.
